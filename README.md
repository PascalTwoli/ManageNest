## Usage Instructions

1. **Login**:  
   Log in to the system using the provided credentials or create a new user (admin or property manager).

2. **Add a Tenant**:  
   Navigate to the "Tenant Manager" page to create a new tenant profile. Fill in the required information such as tenant name, contact details, lease start and end dates, and rent amount.

3. **Track Rent Payments**:  
   Navigate to the "RentPay Manual Tracking" page to manually record rent payments for each tenant. The system will track payment status and display any overdue rent.

4. **Manage Maintenance Requests**:  
   Tenants can submit maintenance requests, and property managers can track the status of these requests (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed).

5. **Monitor Lease Agreements**:  
   Use the "Lease & Payment Tracker" to monitor lease agreements, track renewals, and send reminders for expiring leases.

## System Architecture

The **ManageNest** system follows the traditional **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture. Hereâ€™s an outline of the main components:

1. **Model**: Handles database interactions, such as storing tenant data, rent payments, and maintenance requests.
2. **View**: The frontend interface where users interact with the system. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (React/Angular/Vue.js recommended).
3. **Controller**: Manages the logic between user inputs and the model, ensuring that data is processed correctly.

## Database Structure

The system uses a relational database to store information. Key tables include:

1. **Tenants Table**: Stores tenant profile information.
2. **Payments Table**: Tracks rent payments and payment statuses.
3. **Lease Agreements Table**: Stores details about lease start/end dates and rent amounts.
4. **Maintenance Requests Table**: Logs maintenance issues submitted by tenants.
5. **Units Table**: Tracks each property unit's status and assigned tenant.

## Testing

1. Unit tests are provided to ensure functionality works as expected. You can run the tests using:

    ```

2. Ensure that all tests pass before deploying to production.
